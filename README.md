### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m building

**NativePHP** â€“ Run full Laravel apps natively on Android and iOS  
**Bifrost** â€“ OTA updates, cross-platform builds, and developer infrastructure for mobile Laravel apps

> Laravel should be a *first-class mobile framework*. Iâ€™m making that happen â€” from custom PHP builds to hot reload, push notifications, deep OS integrations, and more.
